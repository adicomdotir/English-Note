Present perfect and past 2 (I have done and I did)

A We do not use the present perfect (I have done) when we talk about a finished time (for example,
yesterday / last year / ten minutes ago etc.). We use a past tense:
It was very cold yesterday. (not has been)
Paul and Lucy arrived ten minutes ago. (not have arrived)
Did you eat a lot of sweets when you were a child? (not have you eaten)
I got home late last night. I was very tired and went straight to bed.

Use the past to ask When … ? or What time … ? :
When did your friends arrive? (not have … arrived)
What time did you finish work?

Compare:
Present perfect
Tom has lost his key. He can’t get
into the house.
Is Carla here or has she left?
Past simple
Tom lost his key yesterday.
He couldn’t get into the house.
When did Carla leave?
Present perfect (have done)
I’ve done a lot of work today.


We use the present perfect for a period of time
that continues until now. For example:
today / this week / since 2010.
It hasn’t rained this week.
Have you seen Anna this morning?
(it is still morning now)
Have you seen Ben recently?
(in the last few days or weeks)
I’ve been working here since 2010.
(I still work here now)
I don’t know where Lisa is. I haven’t seen
her. (= I haven’t seen her recently)
We’ve been waiting for an hour.
(we are still waiting now)
Jack lives in Los Angeles. He has lived
there for seven years.
I’ve never ridden a horse. (in my life)
It’s the last day of your holiday. You say:
It’s been a really good holiday. I’ve really
enjoyed it.

Past simple (did)
I did a lot of work yesterday.
We use the past simple for a finished time in
the past. For example:
yesterday / last week / from 2010 to 2014.
It didn’t rain last week.
Did you see Anna this morning?
(it is now afternoon or evening)
Did you see Ben on Sunday?
I worked here from 2010 to 2014.
(I don’t work here now)
a: Was Lisa at the party on Sunday?
b: I don’t think so. I didn’t see her.
We waited (or were waiting) for an
hour. (we are no longer waiting)
Jack lived in New York for ten years.
Now he lives in Los Angeles.
I never rode a bike when I was a child.
After you come back from holiday you say:
It was a really good holiday. I really
enjoyed it.
